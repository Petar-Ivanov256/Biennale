                         The biennale week takes place in several cities in the months of September-October each two years. The year of the biennale is dedicated 
                         to events concerning various manifestations of glass as a medium of expression, production and consumption. The programme within the period 
                         of one year – the year of the biennale, includes workshops for children, lectures, demonstrations, exhibitions, installations, campaigns etc.',
    'vision_content_second'=>'Our vision is a community where art becomes an integral part of peoples\' lives. To bring that vision into reality, we inspire glass 
                             artists around the world to work, exhibit and share their knowledge, with the only aim to evolve art glass in Europe and especially in 
                             its eastern region. We recognize specific values as essential for reaching our vision and mission. As a team of artists ourselves we pledge
                             that our appearance in the field of fine arts is governed by: respect, cooperation, quality, novelty, development of knowledge, inspiration 
                             and positive thinking.',

      'art_director_description_one'=>'My research as an artist is inspired mainly by glass as it differs substantially from the other traditional materials. 
                                 I am trying to emphasize the qualities and possibilities of glass, whose power of impact is entirely related to light. 
                                 My intention is to concentrate and compile the light through a combination of various in form, size and thickness plastic 
                                 volumes in a certain object, sculpture or composition, which in turn manage to refract, radiate, absorb and reflect
                                 the light in a definite way…',

    'art_director_description_two'=>'The reason to initiate the International biennale of glass is related to the fact that the raw material for the creation of glass in Bulgaria 
                                 is of high quality and I sincerely hope and believe in the renascence of the traditions in the glass industry and this sector in the economy altogether. 
                                 Moreover, glass as a material infiltrates progressively in the fields of architecture and design. The academics of Corning define our time as the Glass Age.',

    'art_director_description_three'=>'The community of artists performing in the field of art glass needs an occasion that unites them by creating a connection between the authors all over the world. 
                                 It is essential for the society to get acquainted with glass as a material and as a means of expression.
                                 Art glass is an enchantment, and as such, it has to be developed in Bulgaria, too. International biennale of glass is a feast, 
                                 in which artists and industry present the magic glass world to the public, a feast in which we gather, exchange ideas and inspiration.',
