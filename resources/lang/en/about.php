It is held in some of the main cities in the country â€“ the capital of Sofia, the marine city of Varna and the town of Beloslav with its glass factory. Our vision is a community where art becomes an integral part of peoples\' lives to create a vivid future for the generations to be. To bring that vision into reality, we inspire glass artists around the world to work, exhibit and share their knowledge, with the only aim to evolve art glass in Europe and especially in its eastern region. We recognize specific values as essential for reaching our vision and mission. As a team of artists ourselves we pledge that our appearance in the field of fine arts is governed by: respect, cooperation, quality, novelty, development of knowledge, inspiration and positive thinking.',
